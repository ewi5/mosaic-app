# Mosaic — building UI (v08)

Left: **sky** with location • weather • time.  
Right: **building** (3×N windows) with people cards: avatar initials (Apple-style colors), `knock` pill + `pol` glowing circle.

This build persists geolocation for 12 hours (so the browser shouldn’t keep asking every refresh).  
Weather is fetched from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) without an API key.

— packaged for Eli (v08)
